# [Definitive Icons](https://themeplaza.art/item/79238)
A collection of over 400 badges, inspired by [Simple Icons](https://themeplaza.art/item/5660) and [Minimalist Folder Badges](https://themeplaza.art/item/7413).

This badge set includes (hopefully) every icon you will ever need for labeling folders and organizing your 3DS home screen.

Includes:
- 73 badges for most major developers/publishers on DS/3DS, including some retro logos.
- 146 badges for most major game franchises playable on GBA, DS, and 3DS
- 42 badges for game genres, with and without text
- 97 badges for most game systems playable on 3DS
- 57 additional miscellaneous badges

I would recommend only putting the badges that you need onto your 3DS, as there are a lot of them, including many alternative versions of the same ones. Use [Anemone](https://github.com/astronautlevel2/Anemone3DS) or [GYTB](https://github.com/MrCheeze/GYTB) to install.

If you have any suggestions for new badges, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Smumbo/DefinitiveIcons/issues), or contact me through the [ThemePlaza Discord server](https://discord.gg/Pz25PX5vr5) (@Smumbo). I'd be happy to make them for you and add them to the next version.
